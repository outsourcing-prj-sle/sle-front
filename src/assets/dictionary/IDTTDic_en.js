      title: 'Internalizing Behavioral Problems',
      description: `are behavior problems in which a person is unable to express their feelings or difficulties to others and keeps them inside or repressed. For example, you might withdraw because you feel like you can't do as well as your friends, feel anxious because you think you're not good enough, or cry alone because you feel like you're the only one, but you don't tell anyone how you feel. Monitoring these behaviors in elementary years is crucial as they can correlate with mental health factors such as depression and anxiety, as well as impact a student's overall functioning, including motivation, executive functioning (attention, concentration, organization, planning), and academic achievement.`,
      red: `This student is prone to frequent depressive and anxious thoughts; he/she may spend a lot of time sitting alone or sitting lethargically; he/she may have a headache or stomachache; or his/her grades may suddenly drop. The student may experience emotional ups and downs or behave in unusual ways. This student needs comprehensive support to look closely at his/her thoughts and feelings, identify more fundamental issues, and address them effectively. Some students, especially those suffering from depression or anxiety, may be difficult to observe because they are not open about their difficulties. In these cases, it is recommended that these students receive counseling from a professional counseling center or a professional counselor.`,
      orange: `Students in this range are reporting the typical or average number of thoughts and behaviors related to anxiety and depression. This student is relatively good at expressing his/her feelings or difficulties to others; therefore, no formal intervention is necessary. However, it is important to provide an environment that the student feels emotionally comfortable and in a good mood. For example, positive peer activities to get along with friends and reflective journaling can help the student learn to look for the positive in what they've been through and learn how to relax themselves. If this student learns to cope in a healthy way with difficult and challenging situations, the student will be able to stay happy and healthy in school.`,
      green: `This student feels less anxious or depressed than his peers and is mentally healthy. This student is not showing signs of feeling overly anxious or sad, displaying no withdrawal behaviors, or having negative thoughts about themselves; therefore, no formal intervention is necessary. However, it's important that you understand how this student is feeling and give them opportunities to express their feelings. This will help the student continue to be happy and healthy in school.`,
      tip: `
      <p>Shifting to positive conversation patterns</p>
      <p>Teachers can help students who often feel depressed and anxious to restore their confidence and reduce stress by changing negative conversation patterns into positive ones.</p>
      <p>Negative: "I'm not good at English, so I'm too afraid to speak English."</p>
      <p class=" mb-[30px]">Positive: "I'm learning English, and I'll get better if I practice a little bit every day.“</p>
      <p>Negative: "I'm too worried that I'll make a mistake in this presentation.“</p>
      <p class=" mb-[30px]">Positive: "I practiced a lot before the presentation, so even if I make a mistake, I have prepared enough that I can still do well.“</p>
      
      <p>Creating positive self-talk</p>
      <p class=" mb-[30px]">Positive self-talk helps students recognize failure as a learning opportunity and allows them to find encouragement in challenging situations.</p>
      <p>"I might fail, but I can learn from my failures.“</p>
      <p>"This is a difficult task for me, but I can solve it if I work hard."</p>`,

      title: 'Externalizing Behavioral Problems',
      description: `refer to behaviors that are directed outwardly and disruptive to others. For example, students with externalizing behavior problems may fidget constantly, joke loudly in class, bully friends, or throw or break things when they are angry. These behaviors can hurt friendships or interfere with other friends'studies. Externalizing behavior problems are often related to behavior problems at home and school, so monitoring these behaviors during the elementary school years is very important. Externalizing behaviors can also interfere with executive functioning skills such as attention, concentration, organization, and planning. Students may struggle academically, as they may have trouble staying focused, completing assignments, and managing time effectively.`,
      red: `Students in this range are reporting significantly higher levels of thoughts and behaviors associated with hyperactivity, attention/concentration, and self-control. This student has externalizing behavior problems and needs attention from others. This student may have difficulty keeping their hands and feet still, keeping moving or waiting for their turn, missing details or misplacing things, or making impulsive decisions without considering the consequences. Teachers and parents may need additional measures and supports to better understand and address this student's challenges. We recommend providing an organized learning environment, structured schedules and breaks, personalized learning strategies, and working with parents to develop a consistent behavior management plan.`,
      orange: `This student's externalizing behavior problems are similar to those of his peers. Occasional distracting or inattentive behaviors may be observed, but this is not a cause for concern. Although no formal intervention is necessary at this time, but he/she does need to reinforce skills to prevent externalizing behavior problems. For example, encouraging activities that maintain and promote physical and mental health, practicing self-regulation strategies for self-care, providing positive reinforcement (praise, rewards, etc.) for desirable behaviors, and learning social skills will lead to healthy and happy relationships and school.`,
      green: `This student has lower than average levels of externalizing behavior problems and is mentally healthy. This student is not reporting concerns for externalizing behavior problems, including inattentive or distracted behavior; therefore, no formal intervention is necessary. However, it is important to continue to reinforce and strengthen these skills, as students who exhibit lower levels of externalizing behavioral problems still benefit from ongoing support and encouragement. It's also important to continue to reinforce social skills and self-regulation strategies that encourage consideration and care for others`,
      tip: `
    <p>•  Guiding personalized learning strategies based on student’s learning style</p>
    <p>- Visual learning style</p>
    <p>Guide students with visual learning styles to use PowerPoint presentations to visually represent key concepts and utilize diagrams, charts, photos, and more.</p>
    <p>- Auditory learning styles</p>
    <p class=" mb-[30px]">Guide students with auditory learning styles to read content aloud or explain what they’ve learned to a friend.</p>
    <p>• Provide consistent rules and rewards</p>
    <p>- Create a learning routine</p>
    <p> Teachers should assign all students a routine (e.g., exercise, reading, homework, etc.) to follow on certain days of the week (e.g., every Friday, Wednesday every two weeks).</p>
    <p>- Reward behavior</p>
    <p>Give praise stickers to students who practice the rules you've created together, and give a small reward (e.g., a prize, certificate, praise, or recognition) to the student who earns the most stickers each month.</p>
    <p>- Example: Clearly explain to students the routine of writing a book report as a homework assignment, and hand out praise stickers every time they turn it in on time. At the end of each month, tally up the number of stickers and give a small gift to the student with the most stickers. Students will be motivated to follow the rules.</p>`,

      title: 'Growth Mindset',
      description: `is the belief and conviction that even if you're not good at something right now, you can get better at it with effort, and that you can take control of your life with this conviction. For example, you might tackle a difficult math problem because you believe that even though it's difficult right now, with more practice you'll get better at it. This growth mindset makes you more likely to try more challenges and perform better. The opposite of a growth mindset is a fixed mindset. It is important to nurture this mindset in students, as research in brain science has shown that our brains have the capacity to adapt and grow, much like a muscle, when they are challenged(neuroplasticity). Therefore, the mindset that one's abilities and intelligence can be developed through one's best efforts and practice can help students grow intellectually.`,
      red: `This student tends to believe that no matter how hard he/she tries, his/her abilities will never improve. People with this fixed mindset typically believe their abilities are limited and try to avoid difficult tasks or challenges. As a result, they are more likely to stay at their current level than to learn new knowledge and skills, and they tend to take criticism or feedback as a personal attack and ignore or avoid it. To help students develop a growth mindset, teachers and parents need to understand their thoughts and feelings and help them see challenges and failures as learning opportunities through ongoing support and positive feedback`,
      orange: `This student has a similar level of self-regulation mindset as his peers, believing that he/she can grow further and being able to regulate his own behavior. While follow-up may not be necessary by teachers, but the student needs to provide ongoing encouragement for his/her efforts. For example, praising and encouraging his/her efforts and perseverance can help improve neuroplasticity(the brain's ability to change and adapt with experience and learning). Additionally, incorporating goal-setting and self-reflection activities and modeling a growth mindset through language and actions may further strengthen their perseverance and resilience`,
      green: `This student has a very high level of personal control mindset, meaning they believe they can improve and can regulate their own behavior. This student is reporting they have high levels of personal control for changing their lives and resulting in high levels of self-efficacy. As a result, no follow-up is necessary for this student by teachers, but they do need encouragement and ongoing support for their conscientiousness and perseverance. It is important to continue reinforcing the value of effort and resilience, promoting a growth mindset, and encouraging the maintenance of their mindsets.`,

            <p class="mb-[30px]">
              • Set small, realistically achievable goals to take steps toward big goals
            </p>
            <p class="mb-[30px]">
              Mid-term goal: Improve math grades<br />
              Set short-term goals to achieve your mid-term goal:<br />
              Short-term goal 1: Solve 5 math problems every day.<br />
              Short-term goal 2: Take a one-hour math remedial class twice a week.<br />
              Short-term goal 3: Retry at least 10 problems you got wrong each week.<br />
              Example: Younghee sets aside 30 minutes each day to solve 5 math problems. Twice a week, she attends a one-hour remedial math class offered by her school. At the end of each week, she reviews by redoing at least 10 problems she got wrong that week. Achieving these small goals helps her move toward her big goals.

            <p>• Help students develop a sense of agency and self-efficacy</p>
            <p class="ml-[10px]">- Guide students to make their own decisions</p>
            <p>
              Teachers guide students to create their own weekly study plans. By following a self-determined plan, students feel a sense of ownership and self-efficacy.

      title: 'Emotion Knowledge',
      description: ` is related to the ability to correctly identify, understand, and manage emotions, both within oneself and in others. This includes understanding how someone might feel in a given situation and accurately labeling those emotions, as well as identifying coping strategies for dealing with various emotions. For example, emotional knowledge includes meeting people who feel various emotions, choosing appropriate emotional words to continue the conversation, and responding appropriately, such as empathizing, helping, and listening to their stories. Students with strong emotion knowledge have been found to have better ability to navigate social interactions, build positive relationships, and resolve conflicts effectively. Additionally, they are more adept at understanding and managing their own emotions, leading to greater emotional resilience, general well-being, and high academic achievement.`,
      red: `This student tends to have difficulty understanding and managing his or her own and others' emotions. When talking to peers, he or she may be misunderstood or taken seriously, which may hurt him or her, and he or she may have many conflicts with his or her friends because he or she is unable to express his or her emotions appropriately. Teachers and parents should provide a Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) program that includes activities and discussions to learn about emotions and coping methods for the student to gain emotional knowledge. Students who need more intensive and in-depth programs may benefit from individual or group counseling with a mental health professional`,
      orange: `This student has similar emotional knowledge to his/her peers in recognizing, understanding, and managing his/her own and others’ emotions. This student is also relatively adept at recognizing other people’s emotions and developing emotional coping strategies. Although he/she does not currently need special help from teachers, teachers and family around the student should be aware of the benefits of social-emotional learning (SEL) and actively utilize it. In particular, story-based or scenario-based social-emotional learning (SEL) that encourages students to think about emotions in various situations, including their own thoughts and feelings, can enhance emotional intelligence and happiness. In addition, modeling healthy emotional expression and emotion regulation skills, as well as various emotional expressions, can also be very helpful.`,
      green: `This student has a very high level of emotional knowledge, which is the ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions in oneself and others. This student accurately identifies other people’s emotions, is skilled in emotional coping strategies, and has a high level of understanding of emotion regulation. Although this student does not need special help from the teacher, it is important to engage in social-emotional learning (SEL) consistently. In particular, story-based or scenario-based SEL that encourages students to think about emotions in various situations can help maintain a high level of emotional knowledge.`,
      tip: `
    <p>• Practice expressing emotions</p>
    <p>- Emotion word lesson: Teachers set aside time once a week to teach a variety of emotion words.</p>
    <p class="mb-[30px]">- Related activity: Show students pictures related to the emotion words, explain the meaning of each word, and then have students choose the emotion of the day from the emotion word cards.</p>
    <p>• Role-play different scenarios</p>
    <p> Teachers work with students to create various different scenarios. For example, a conflict with a friend, making a new friend, asking a teacher a question, etc. </p>
    <p class="mb-[30px]"> Students take on different roles and act out the situation. The teacher observes and provides feedback. For example, "Why don’t you say this way ~ when you have a conflict with a friend." or "You should do it this way ~ when you make a new friend."</p>
    <p>• Support social-emotional learning programs</p>
    <p>- Emotion journaling program: Each day, students write about how they felt that day and why in an emotion journal. Teachers go over students’emotion journals with them and talk about ways to manage stress.</p>
    <p>For example, they ask questions like, "What made you feel stressed today? How can you cope with that situation?" to help students understand and manage their emotions.</p>
